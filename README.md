HsQML is a Haskell binding to Qt Quick, a cross-platform framework for creating
graphical user interfaces. For further information on installing and using it,
please see the project's web site.

## Notes
- I made some changes, so this library works on newer GHC / cabal versions and has been tested on Qt5.
- This library has been tested with cabal 3.10.3.0, due to its custom Setup.hs, not all versions of cabal are supported.
- **Current Status:** This is a maintained fork of the original HsQML project.
